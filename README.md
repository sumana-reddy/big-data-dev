## Current
Currently I'm pursuing  Master's degree in Applied Computer Science and this is my final semester. I will be graduated in May 2021.

## Background
I have done my Under graduation in Computer Science at KL University, Vijayawada. My major is "Cyber Security" and have had hands on in cyber algorithms and written a new algorithm for both encryption, decryption and published my paper in International Journal. Enact delivery upon completion of projects and ensure that delivery adheres to agile practices maintained in the curriculum. Travelling is one of my hobbies.

## Plans
After my Graduation I would like to work as a Java full stack developer.
